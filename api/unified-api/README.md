# Unified API

A Unified API aggregates multiple APIs into a single, standardized interface, simplifying integration and reducing complexity for developers. It provides a consistent endpoint, authentication, and data model, making it easier to interact with various services. This approach enhances functionality and speeds up development by minimizing the need for custom integrations.
